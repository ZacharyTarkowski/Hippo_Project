# Hippo_Project

Plays an idle animation until an IR sensor is triggered, then plays the active animation on a TFT screen.

Will be a cartoon hippo for my moms classroom.

"Animation" is a strong word, it rotates between a series of pictures.

Lazy hack to not use the SD card is to run-length encode the images.
